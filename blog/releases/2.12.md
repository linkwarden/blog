# Announcing Linkwarden 2.12

Today, we're excited to announce the release of **[Linkwarden 2.12](https://linkwarden.app/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=v2_12_announcement)**! 🥳 This update brings significant improvements and new features to enhance your experience.

For those who are new to Linkwarden, it’s basically a tool for saving and organizing webpages, articles, and documents all in one place. It’s great for bookmarking stuff to read later, and you can also share your resources, create public collections, and collaborate with your team. Linkwarden is available as a **[Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** subscription or you can **[self-host](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation)** it on your own server.

This release brings a range of updates to make your bookmarking and archiving experience even smoother. Let’s take a look:

## What’s new:

### 🫧 Drag and Drop Support

One of our most requested features is finally here! You can now drag and drop Links onto Collections and Tags. This makes it much easier to organize your bookmarks and keep everything tidy.

Here’s a quick demo:

### 📤 Upload from SingleFile

SingleFile is an awesome browser extension that allows you to save complete webpages as a single HTML file on your device. As of Linkwarden 2.12, you can upload your saved links directly from the SingleFile browser extension into Linkwarden. This allows you to easily save articles which are behind paywalls or require authentication directly from your browser.

To use this feature, simply install the SingleFile extension, and then follow the [documentation](https://docs.linkwarden.app/usage/upload-from-singlefile).

### 🌐 Progressed Translations

We’ve made significant progress in our translations, with many languages now fully supported. If you’re interested in helping out with translations, check out our [Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/linkwarden).

### ✅ And more...

There are also a bunch of smaller improvements and fixes in this release to keep everything running smoothly.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden/compare/v2.11.8...v2.12.0

## Want to skip the technical setup?

If you’d rather skip server setup and maintenance, our **[Cloud Plan](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** takes care of everything for you. It’s a great way to access all of Linkwarden’s features—plus future updates—without the technical overhead.

We hope you enjoy these new enhancements, and as always, we'd like to express our sincere thanks to all of our supporters and contributors. Your feedback and contributions have been invaluable in shaping Linkwarden into what it is today. 🚀
