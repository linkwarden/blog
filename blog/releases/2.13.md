# Announcing Linkwarden 2.13

Today, we're excited to announce the release of **[Linkwarden 2.13](https://linkwarden.app/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=v2_13_announcement)**! 🥳 This update brings significant improvements and new features to enhance your experience.

For those who are new to Linkwarden, it’s basically a tool to collect, read, annotate, and fully preserve webpages, articles, and documents, all in one place. It’s great for bookmarking stuff to read later, and you can also share your resources, create public collections, and collaborate with your team. Linkwarden is available as a **[Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** subscription or you can **[self-host](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation)** it on your own server.

This release brings a range of updates to make your bookmarking and archiving experience even smoother. Let’s take a look:

You can now shrink the sidebar for a more compact and minimal look.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
