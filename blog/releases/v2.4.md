## What's New?

:::tip

We're actively bringing new features to Linkwarden users around the globe. If you like our work, please [Star our repo on GitHub](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden)! ⭐️ Your support means a lot to us.

### 🎨 Much Improved Design

Enjoy a visual upgrade with sleeker icons, enhanced coloring, and redesigned link cards for a more engaging experience. Huge thanks to [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) for this!

### 🏛️ All Bookmarks Now Get Archived!

There is a background script that automatically processes each link, creating archived versions without any user intervention. So from now on, every bookmark you save, **including those imported from other sources**, is automatically preserved, this means you'll have access to your favorite article even if the original content is gone!

### 📋 Added Compact List View

This new feature introduces a list-based format for viewing bookmarks. It's designed for those who prefer a more structured and straightforward way to browse their saved links. This view can be especially handy for quickly scanning through numerous bookmarks, making it easier to find what you're looking for.

### 👍 Enhanced User Experience

There are many improvements made to enhance the user experience of the app, like for instance you can now add new Collections right from the navbar. Also when you try to delete a Link, you get a "Are you sure" prompt to prevent accidentally deletion of your Links.

### 🔐 Added Many More Single Sign-On and Oauth Integrations

From Authentik, to Apple, Google, and more... The list goes on.

:::note

SSO integration is only available for **Enterprise** and **self-hosted** users. <br/>
For self-hosted users, please visit the **[docs](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/sso-oauth)** for more info on setting up everything.

### 🌐 Relocated Our Server

It's also worth mentioning that we've moved our [Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) instance server to Hetzner's data center in Virginia, USA, and our S3 bucket is now in NYC, optimizing performance and reliability.
