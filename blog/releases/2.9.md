## What’s new:

### ✨ Local AI Tagging (Optional)

We've added a new feature that automatically tags your links based on their content. This feature uses a local AI model to analyze the content of your links and can assign tags to links in 2 ways:

1. **Auto-generate Tags**: When a link is added, Linkwarden will automatically generate and assign tags based on the content of the link.
2. **Using Predefined Tags**: You can also use predefined tags to let Linkwarden auto-assign tags based on the content of the link.

You can enable this feature in the Settings > Preferences page. If you're self-hosting Linkwarden, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/ai-worker) for more information on how to set up and use this feature.
