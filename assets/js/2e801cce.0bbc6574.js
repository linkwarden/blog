This frustrating experience is known as \\"Link Rot,\\" a common issue in the ever-evolving digital landscape. In this post, we\'ll explore what link rot is, why it happens, and practical solutions to mitigate its impact.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What is Link Rot?\\n\\nLink Rot occurs when hyperlinks on the internet become obsolete or broken. It\'s similar to having a map that leads to a location that no longer exists. In the digital world, these are links that once led to active web pages but now lead to dead ends, resulting in the loss of valuable online resources for everyone.\\n\\n## How common is it?\\n\\nLink Rot is actually pretty common. In fact, a [recent study](https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-rot-study/) showed that more than 66% of links to websites in the last 9 years are dead. This means we\'re only dealing with less than 34% of the internet since then!\\n\\n## Why Does Link Rot Happen?\\n\\n1. **Webpage Removal or Relocation:** Websites are dynamic. Content gets deleted, moved, or updated, often without redirecting the old links to the new pages. A small example of why a website might choose to do this is illustrated in this article: [CNET is deleting old articles to try to improve its Google Search ranking](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826342/cnet-content-pruning-deleting-articles-google-seo).\\n\\n2. **Domain Changes:** Changes in domain names or website ownership can lead to link rot, as previous links may not be preserved.\\n\\n3. **Expired Content:** Some content is time-sensitive or temporary, leading to its eventual removal or deletion.\\n\\n4. **Technical Issues:** Server problems and changes in URL structures can also make a link inactive.\\n\\n## The Solution to Link Rot\\n\\n1. **Regular Link Audits:** Website owners should regularly check and update their links. Tools like broken link checkers can automate this process.\\n\\n2. **Using Permalinks:** When possible, use permalinks which are less likely to change over time.\\n\\n3. **Implementing Redirects:** If a page is moved, setting up a redirect from the old URL to the new one can prevent link rot.\\n\\n4. **Archiving Services:** Using a bookmark and web archiving service like [Linkwarden](https://linkwarden.app) not only helps you to preserve webpages automatically but also offers powerful organization features. Linkwarden works by generating screenshots, PDFs, and other formats from a webpage, ensuring accessibility to the link content even if the original content is gone.\\n\\n## Verdict\\n\\nLink Rot is an inevitable part of the internets lifecycle. However, understanding its causes and implementing effective strategies can significantly reduce its impact. By being proactive and using the right tools and practices, we can ensure a more stable and user-friendly digital experience."},{"id":"/releases/v2.2","metadata":{"permalink":"/releases/v2.2","editUrl":"https://github.com/linkwarden/blog/blob/main/blog/releases/v2.2.md","source":"@site/blog/releases/v2.2.md","title":"Linkwarden 2.2","description":"We\'re happy to announce Linkwarden 2.2!","date":"2023-11-11T10:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 11, 2023","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/tags/release"}],"readingTime":0.225,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel","title":"Linkwarden maintainer","url":"https://github.com/daniel31x13","email":"hello@daniel31x13.io","imageURL":"https://github.com/daniel31x13.png","key":"daniel"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"daniel","date":"2023-11-11T10:00","tags":["release"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Link Rot and Its Impact on the Web","permalink":"/articles/link-rot-and-its-impact-on-the-web-1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Linkwarden 2.1","permalink":"/releases/v2.1"}},"content":"We\'re happy to announce **[Linkwarden 2.2](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden)**!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What\'s New?\\n\\n### \ud83d\udccc New Pinned Links Route\\n\\nView all your pinned links in a separate route.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf9a\ufe0f Clear Links Instead of Blurred\\n\\nYou can now make the icons clear instead of blurred.\\n\\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0"},{"id":"/releases/v2.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/releases/v2.1","editUrl":"https://github.com/linkwarden/blog/blob/main/blog/releases/v2.1.md","source":"@site/blog/releases/v2.1.md","title":"Linkwarden 2.1","description":"We\'re happy to announce Linkwarden 2.1!","date":"2023-11-10T10:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 10, 2023","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/tags/release"}],"readingTime":0.385,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel","title":"Linkwarden maintainer","url":"https://github.com/daniel31x13","email":"hello@daniel31x13.io","imageURL":"https://github.com/daniel31x13.png","key":"daniel"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"daniel","date":"2023-11-10T10:00","tags":["release"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Linkwarden 2.2","permalink":"/releases/v2.2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Announcing Linkwarden 2.0","permalink":"/releases/v2.0"}},"content":"We\'re happy to announce **[Linkwarden 2.1](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden)**!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What\'s New?\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd25 Better Looking Dashboard Stats\\n\\nEnjoy a more visually appealing overview of your stats at a glance.\\n\\n![Screenshot](/img/v2.1/redesigned-stats.jpeg)\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf9a\ufe0f Toggle Blurred Link Icons Visibility\\n\\nYou can now choose to disable the visibility of the blurred link icons based on your preferences.\\n\\n### \u2139\ufe0f Display Version Number\\n\\nStay informed with the version number displayed right at the bottom of your settings sidebar.\\n\\n![Screenshot](/img/v2.1/version-number.jpeg)\\n\\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0"},{"id":"/releases/v2.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/releases/v2.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/linkwarden/blog/blob/main/blog/releases/v2.0.md","source":"@site/blog/releases/v2.0.md","title":"Announcing Linkwarden 2.0","description":"Today, we are happy to announce Linkwarden 2.0! \ud83e\udd73","date":"2023-11-07T10:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/tags/release"}],"readingTime":1.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel","title":"Linkwarden maintainer","url":"https://github.com/daniel31x13","email":"hello@daniel31x13.io","imageURL":"https://github.com/daniel31x13.png","key":"daniel"}],"frontMatter":{"authors":"daniel","date":"2023-11-07T10:00","image":"https://blog.linkwarden.app/assets/images/v2.0-launch-9d5e77cb1606aecfab6f14a0127519a7.jpeg","tags":["release"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Linkwarden 2.1","permalink":"/releases/v2.1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Linkwarden 1.2","permalink":"/releases/v1.2"}},"content":"Today, we are happy to announce **[Linkwarden 2.0](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden/releases/tag/v2.0.0)**! \ud83e\udd73\\n\\nThis is a new **major** version of Linkwarden, coming with many exciting new features and optimizations.\\n\\nBefore we start, we\'d like to express our sincere thanks to all of our [Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) subscription users.
